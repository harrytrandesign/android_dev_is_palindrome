This is an Android application built around the concept of allowing a user to check whether a given string is a palindrome.

A palindrome is defined as a word or phrase which reads the same when spelled either backwards or forwards.

Examples of Palindromes: "nurses run" and "racecar" are both palindrome.

This app was created as practice while studying the Udacity Grow with Google Challenge Scholarship Android Dev lessons, using content learned from lessons 1 through 8.

The application utilizes a RecyclerView and SQLite Database, words that are entered are stored in a local SQLite Database on the user's device. A history of words that were searched is shown in a RecyclerView. Words in the RecyclerView can be swiped to delete from the database, the database uses CRUD operations built into the Android Framework.

Everything was done inside Android Studio, written in Java, and UI Designs were created by myself. The application follows a Material Design style guide.

Feedback and comments are welcomed.
